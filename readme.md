# Parser Project with Bison and Flex

This project is a parser for a custom language. It uses **Bison** and **Flex** to analyze and validate textual inputs according to a well-defined grammar. The parser reads input, tokenizes it, and builds a syntax tree for validation.

## Project Files

1. **rendu.y**: Defines the grammar for the syntax parser using Bison, including production rules for expressions and conditional structures.

2. **rendu.l**: Lexical analyzer defined with Flex, which breaks down the input into tokens for analysis.

3. **y.tab.h**: Token definitions generated by Bison, linking the lexical analyzer with the parser.

4. **rendu.tab.c**: Parser code generated by Bison, used to validate and analyze the input syntactically.

5. **tokens.h**: Contains token declarations to identify components of the language.

6. **structs.h**: Declares data structures, such as syntax tree nodes, used in the project.

7. **structs.c**: Implements functions for creating and manipulating data structures defined in `structs.h`.

8. **fcntstruct.c**: Provides additional functions for data structure manipulation, complementing `structs.c`.

9. **lex.yy.c** and **rendu.tab.c**: Generated by Flex and Bison, representing the lexical analyzer (`lex.yy.c`) and the parser (`rendu.tab.c`), respectively.

## Project Overview

These files work together to analyze textual input, build a syntax tree, and execute instructions based on defined grammar rules.

The workflow is as follows:

1. **Lexical Analysis**: `rendu.l` is used by Flex to tokenize the input into elements like identifiers and operators.
2. **Syntax Analysis**: `rendu.y` is used by Bison to verify the structure of the tokens, building a syntax tree.
3. **Data Structures**: `structs.h`, `structs.c`, and `fcntstruct.c` create and manipulate the data structures representing the program elements.

## Compilation and Execution

To compile the project, use the following commands (assuming Bison and Flex are installed):

```bash
bison -d rendu.y
flex rendu.l
gcc rendu.tab.c lex.yy.c structs.c fcntstruct.c -o parser
```

This will produce an executable named `parser` that you can use to analyze and validate your custom language input.
